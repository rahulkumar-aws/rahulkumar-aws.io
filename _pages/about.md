I have over 11 years of hands-on experience in product development with big data, analytics, and cloud computing. I am passionate about harnessing data's potential for innovation and scalability, and I have a proven track record of delivering high-quality and high-performance data solutions for various industries, such as AdTech, Retail, Security, and Pharmacy.

In my current role, I leverage my skills and certifications in Amazon Elastic MapReduce (EMR), AWS Databricks, H2O.ai, and other cutting-edge technologies to design and implement data pipelines, data lakes, data warehouses, and data science platforms. I also collaborate with cross-functional teams of data scientists, analysts, and business stakeholders to understand their data needs and provide them with actionable insights and recommendations. I am always eager to learn new skills and tools, and I strive to keep myself updated with the latest trends and best practices in the field of data engineering.
